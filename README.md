# NixOS configuration

Here kept configuration of my NixOS system. Currently it is absolutely raw, poorly managed, with tons of patches, hardware specific(NVidia), but, overall, works.

## Key points
What it made of

### UI
- Window system: **Wayland**
- Composer: **Hyprland**
- Lock: **swaylock**
- Login manager: **greetd** and **tui-greed**
- Notifications: **Dunst**
- Bar: **Waybar**
- Launcher: **Wofi**


### Credits
Based on the configuration of some nice folk whom I cannot find, because the base of the system was made a long time ago :(

Once I found you - I'll add you :)
